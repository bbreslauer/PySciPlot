1) Create the spec file (only need to do once)

python2 ~/usr/local/pyinstaller/Makespec.py -n psp ../src/main.py

--or--

python2 ~/usr/local/pyinstaller/Makespec.py --onefile -n pspone ../src/main.py


2) Build the project

python2 ~/usr/local/pyinstaller/Build.py psp.spec











OTHER STUFF TO DO
Create the hooks file
edit the PyQt4.Qt hooks file in pyinstaller files, adding the modules that don't exist there

you can use the verbose option with pyinstaller to determine what is getting loaded from the wrong location
