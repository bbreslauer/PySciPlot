# IMPORTANT

FIRST THING TO DO
UPDATE TRACE SO THAT IT IS USING PROPERTIES.
REWRITE PLOT REFRESH METHOD INTO A BUNCH OF update_ METHODS, LIKE IN FIGURE. 
REWRITE EDITFIGUREDIALOG COMPLETELY. NEED TO INCLUDE IN THE INITIALIZATION A WAY TO SET ALL THE UI FIELDS ON ALL 3 TABS TO THE DEFAULTS IN THE RESPECTIVE OBJECTS.

*************************
NEXT THING: the apply button on the scatterplotwidget does not update the trace options. get that working
*************************




EVERY TIME APPLY IS CLICKED, TEXTOPTIONS OR TEXTFORMAT IS COMPLETELY REPLACED, RESULTING IN ALL THE PROPERTIES WITHIN IT EMITTING A MODIFIED SIGNAL. THIS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED SO THAT IT IS NOT COMPLETELY REPLACED, BUT ONLY THE PROPERTIES THAT HAVE CHANGED ARE MODIFIED.



DONE - plot axes need to be able to have limits that are non-integers

createwavedialog
    DONE - need to remove duplicate arguments in lambda definition and eval statement
    DONE - need to change how the blank entries in the data table view are done, so that they don't show up in the actual waves.  the blank entries can cause issues with function definitions, and also it isn't very clean.




when changing data in a table, there are too many plot updates

DONE - add default values to properties

DONE - need to change from configparser to xml.dom in order to be able to save multiple traces in a plot (or multiple plots in a figure)

separate out tick label vs actual ticks, so that one can be displayed without the other (or at least labels can be hidden)
DONE - need to change QColorButton to act more like QTextOptionsButton, with an internal store instead of just pulling from the label text.  then we might be able to use alphas as well.
    line 209 of Plot.py contains the necessary code to incorporate alpha transparency to any color











inputting formula and special characters (perhaps with latex syntax)

shift data points (like x + 5, for all values in x)

controlling tick marks (how many, how large, major/minor, minimum spacing, inside/outside, etc)

export to any format (esp. eps)

locking the graph window size, so you can see how it will look

saving preferences as default, so all graphs will have the same look

use wave as tick labels.  look at jesse conversation on 5/23/2010 for more info about this
